# resource-metabolism

A playground space for developing simulation models of production, storage, and consumption of resources. Until further conceptual refining, the term resource contains both "natural resources" or materials not processed by human activities AND goods (as the things produced by activities given certain inputs, including certain resources). So-called "immaterial resources" will be considered, yet deserving their own particular term more often than not. Multiple design alternatives are explored using multiple programming languages.
