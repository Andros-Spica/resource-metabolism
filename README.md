# resource-metabolism

A playground space for developing simulation models of production, storage, and consumption of resources. Until further conceptual refining, the term resource contains both "natural resources" (not processed by human activities) and artifacts (produced by activities given certain inputs, including certain resources). So-called "immaterial resources" will either not be considered or modelled as phenomena outside the resource framework. Multiple design alternatives are explored using multiple programming languages.
